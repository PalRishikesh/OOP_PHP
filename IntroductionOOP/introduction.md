Q What is Procedural language
=> In Procedural languatge you write statments or line of code for the computer to execute
=> You tell the computer what to do in basic steps
=> You have only variables and functions doing all the work for you and all the code is in one main function (Eg. C language)

OOP's
#OOP is discover by "Alan kay"
=> This Universe is full of object like sun,earth,moon,houses,car and everything is an object.
=> Every object has it own properties and some of them also has abilities to perform some specific actions.
=> One more thing these objects can also interact with each other.

Q What about the class and how to understand them
=> Some objects are same, their behavior is exactly same but they are slightly different in their properties.
Eg. Dog
-- Properties: Name,Color, breed
-- Behavior: Barking,Fetching, waggling tail, chasing cat

=> Behavior is same but properties change like name,color,breed.

#OOP
=> It is style of programming that focussess on using objects and their itneractions to design and build the applications

#class
=>A Class is a blueprint or prototypes that define the variables and the methods common to all objects of certain kind

#object
=> An Object is a software bundle of variables and related methods.
=> Everything around us is an object like car, a pencil, a table, a dog, you and me.
=> We can say that " Classes are common nouns" and "Objects are proper nouns".
=> Each Object belong to particular class.
=> If we ask to tell me the similarity between dog,cat,lion,zebra than you will say that all of these are animals which mean all of them belongs to class 'Animal'.
=> We can futher subdivided to Animal in Wild Animal and Domestic Animal.
=> Every object has states and behavior.
=> Take an Example of a class "Animal" and its object "Dog".
=> Now we all know that a Dog has States:Name,Color,breed,etc and Behavior:Barking,running,fetching,wagging tails, etc.
=> These states are called "Variables" and Behavior are called "Method" or "function".
=> Now we can define these variables and methods in class 'Animal' and call these methods anytime after creation of its Object 'a Dong'.

#advantages
=>Easy to map to real-world situations.
=>Code Resuse and Recycling.
=>Easy to write modular code.
=>Obect oriented system can be easily upgraded from smaller to larger systems.
